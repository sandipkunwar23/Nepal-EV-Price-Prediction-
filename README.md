# Nepal-EV-Price-Prediction-
Nepal has seen an electric vehicle revolution over few years. More than 70% of the vehicle in the roads of Nepal are electric. The growth in number of charging station near my home has led me to analyse the types and features of the vehicles. Most of them are imported from China or India. This is a simple project that tries to make sense of some of the data of the electric vehicles imported in Nepal. 
This repository contains two notebooks:
1. Web scrapping: Scrapping the electric vehicles data(brand, model, battery, range, motor and price) that are available for sale in Nepal. Selenium driver is used to perform the webscrapping. 

2. EDAandPrediction: Performing exploratory data analysis, visualizing price distributions, and other statistical metrics to understand the EV price market. Finally applying varioud machine learning algorithms, and comparing the MAE, RMSE and R² scores.

Highlights:
Web-scrapping
EDA
Machine Learning algortihms

Tools and Libraries
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib / seaborn, scikit learn
