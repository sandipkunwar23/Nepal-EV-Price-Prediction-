# Nepal-EV-Price-Prediction-
This repository contains two notebooks:
1. Web scrapping: Scrapping the electric vehicle data(brand, model, battery, range, motor and price). Selenium driver is used to perform the webscrapping.

2. EDAandPrediction: Performing exploratory data analysis, visualizing price distributions, and other variables. And applying machine learning algorithms, and finally compare the MAE, RMSE and R² scores.

Highlights:
Web-scrapping
EDA
Machine Learning algortihms

Tools and Libraries
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib / seaborn, scikit learn
