Nepal has experienced a rapid rise in electric vehicle (EV) adoption in recent years. According to The New York Times, electric vehicles accounted for around 70–76% of new passenger vehicle sales in Nepal during 2024–25, making it one of the fastest EV adoption rates globally. This growth is driven by favorable import policies, low electricity costs from hydropower, and expanding charging infrastructure.

This mini project focuses on analyzing four-wheeler personal electric vehicles available in the Nepalese market and exploring how vehicle specifications relate to their market prices.

Project Objective

The objectives of this project are:
   1. To collect data on electric four-wheeler vehicles sold in Nepal
   2. To explore and analyze EV specifications and price trends
   3. To apply standard machine learning regression algorithms to estimate EV prices

Data Source: All data used in this project was collected from: https://www.ev-nepal.com/
Only personal four-wheeler electric vehicles listed on the website were included in the dataset.

Methodology:
   1. Data collected using Selenium WebDriver.
   2. Scraped data stored as a CSV file.
   3. CSV imported for analysis and visualization.
   4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed.
   5. Regression models from scikit-learn (including Random Forest) applied for price estimation.

Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, scikit-learn, Selenium

Notes
This project is exploratory in nature and intended as a mini-project to understand the Nepalese EV market using real-world data.
